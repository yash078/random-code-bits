# Random Codes Repo
A collection of codes I created while learning some languaes:
* `self.js`: JavaScript code to find [self describing numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-descriptive_number).
* `self.py`: python code to find self describing numbers.
* `bin_search.cs`: a C# recursive implementation of the binary search algorithm based on array slicing.
